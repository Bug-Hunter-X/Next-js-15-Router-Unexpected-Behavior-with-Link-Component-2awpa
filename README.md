# Next.js 15 Router Unexpected Behavior with Link Component

This repository demonstrates a potential issue with the Next.js 15 router, specifically concerning unexpected behavior when using the `Link` component in conjunction with dynamic routes or complex routing setups.

## Problem Description

The issue is observed when using Next.js 15's `Link` component to navigate between pages. The navigation either fails to work as expected, causing unexpected routing behavior or triggering routing-related errors. This could manifest as incorrect page rendering, unintended redirects, or errors in the console.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Run the development server using `npm run dev`.
4. Attempt to navigate between pages using the links provided in `pages/index.js`.
5. Observe any discrepancies in expected versus actual routing behavior.

## Potential Causes

The issue might be related to:
* Incorrect usage of dynamic segments in `href` props.
* Conflicting routing configurations.
* Interactions with other middleware or API routes.
* Issues related to the new app router in Next.js 15. 

## Solution

The solution may require carefully reviewing the routing configuration, making sure dynamic segments are correctly handled, and resolving any conflicts that might exist with other aspects of the application's routing structure.
